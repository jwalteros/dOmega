 * @brief  Graph represesentation class consisting of the adjacency lists of its
 * vertices.
 *
 * @details This class reads either a standard edge type file or an adjacency
 * lists file (@see Graph::Graph for details). The Graph class also implements a
 * procedure that generates a degeneracy ordering of the given graph
 * (@see Graph::degeneracyOrdering)and a procedure that outputs the complement
 * of the subgraph induced by a given vertex v and it's neighbors to the right
 * in the degeneracy ordering.
