 * @brief Finds The maximum clique of a graph.
 *
 * @details This code implements an efficient algorithm for the maximum clique
 * problem that runs in time polynomial in the graph's size, but exponential
 * in the difference $d-\omega$ (where $d$ denotes the graph's degeneracy).
 * When this difference is a constant, the running time is ${O}(dm)={O}(m^{1.5})$.
 * Since 70% of common test instances have $d-\omega \le 3$, our implementation
 * performs rather well and is competitive with previous approaches.
 * Key subroutines in our approach include existing kernelization and
 * fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for vertex cover.
 *
 * Please cite the following paper if used:
 * Jose L. Walteros and Austin L. Buchanan. Why is maximum clique easy in practice?
