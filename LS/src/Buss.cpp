 *
 * @details Implements the Buss kernel. It removes the vertices with degree
 * larger than @param k and the resulting isolated vertices. The resulting
 * kernel is constructed in the @param kernel.
 *
 * If the procedure removes more high degree vertices than @param k, it will
 * return -1 (no VC) without constructing the kernel. If no vertex is removed,
 * @param kernel is set to @param sG (the original input).
 *
 * If the resulting number of vertices in the kernel is les than @param k minus
 * the number of large degree vertices, the procedure returns 1, as there is a
 * VC.
 *
 * If the resulting number of edges is greater than k*(k-highDegVertices), the
 * procedure returns -1 as there is no VC.
