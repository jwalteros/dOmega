 *
 * @brief Finds if a graph has a vertex cover of size k.
 *
 * @details The procedure performs the following tasks until there is no further
 * update:
 *
 * 1. Any isolated vertex is removed.
 * 2. If there is a vertex v with degree 1, both v and its neighbor are removed
 *    and k is decreased by 1.
 * 3. If there is a graph v with degree 2:
 *    a. If its neighbors u and w are adjacent, u, v, and w are removed and k is
 *    decreased by 2.
 *    b. If its neighbors u and w are not adjacent, u and w are removed and its
 *    neighbors are attatched to v (vertex folding). k is decreased by 1.
 *
 * Then, the vertex v with the largest degree is selected. The procedure
 * generates one branch in which v is assumed to be in the vertex cover. That is,
 * v is removed and k is decreased by 1. A second branch is created assuming the
 * vertices in N(k) in the vertex cover. That is, N[k] are removed and k is
 * decreased by |N(v)|.
