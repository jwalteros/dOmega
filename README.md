dOmega Library
=====================================

This code implements an efficient algorithm for the maximum clique
problem that runs in time polynomial in the graph's size, but exponential
in the clique-core gap g:=(d+1)-omega (where d denotes the graph's degeneracy and omega
the size of the largest clique).

When this gap $g$ can be treated as a constant, as is often the case for real-life graphs,
the proposed algorithm runs in time $O(dm)=O(m^{1.5})$.
Key subroutines in our approach include existing kernelization and
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for vertex cover.

Please cite the following paper if used:
Jose L. Walteros and Austin L. Buchanan. Why is maximum clique often easy in practice?

The code implements the following modules:

* **Degeneracy:** Given a simple undirected graph G, the code outputs the graph's degeneracy an a valid degeneracy ordering.
* **Maximum clique:** Given a simple undirected graph G, the code finds the size of the largest clique.

The code includes two implementations of the algorithm (LS and BS(. The main difference between both implementations is the way in which the algorithm performs the search (see Jose L. Walteros and Austin L. Buchanan. Why is maximum clique often easy in practice? for further details).

Usage
---------

### Compiling the code
The library provides a simple makefile to compile the library. The library has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu and CentOS), macOS X (Mavericks-Sierra), and Windows (Cygwin and VS)  

* **For the LS version:**
		$ cd path/dOmega/LS
		$ make

* **For the BS version:**
              $ cd path/dOmega/BS
              $ make


### Input file format
The code can receive as input adjacency lists and edge list files. See the dat folder for a few examples:

* **Adjacency lists**  
The first line of the file must include the number vertices and edges. The vertices must be labeled from 1 to n.

		%% Adjacency lists of a 6-vertex, 6-edge graph
		6 6
		2 3 4
		1 3 5
		1 2 6
		1
		2
		3


* **Edge list**  
The first line of the file must include the number vertices and edges. The vertices must be labeled from 0 to n-1.

		%% Edge list of a 6-vertex, 6-edge graph
		6 6
		0 1
		0 2
		0 3
		1 2
		1 4
		2 5


### Running the code

* **Degeneracy***  
To find the degeneracy ordering of a graph use:  
./dOmega [file type] [filename] -d

		# Finds the degeneracy ordering of the graph described by edge list file testEdge.txt
		./dOmega -e ../dat/testEdge.txt -d

		# Finds the degeneracy ordering of the graph described by adjacency list file testAdj.txt
		./dOmega -a ../dat/testAdj.txt -d


* **Maximum Clique***  
To find the size of the maximum clique of a graph use:  
./dOmega [file type] [filename] -m [optional: num. processors to use]

		# Finds the size of the maximum clique of the graph described by
		# edge list file testEdge.txt 3 processors
		./dOmega -e ../dat/testEdge.txt -m -k 3
